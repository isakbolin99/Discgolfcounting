# Discgolfcounting

## Description
The idea of discolfcounting was born in 2019 when I had no idea about how many players were using my newly built discgolfcourse: https://udisc.com/courses/tjaerna-sandtag-ZUlv. Since discoglf is usually free to play, it is hard to estimate the number of players in my city and the rest of the country. To solve this problem I built a footfall counter that counts all the players on the course.
